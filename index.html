									<h2 class="major">MY JOURNEY</h2>
									<p>Growing up, I was always captivated by technology and its ability to evolve constantly. Although I didn’t have a personal computer as a child, I spent countless hours in public libraries after school, where I could access computers to complete my assignments. This experience opened my eyes to the incredible potential of technology and the transformative power of computers as tools for human advancement.
										In high school, I pursued a CTE program focused on robotics, driven by a desire to build a solid foundation in computer science. Being accepted into this program was a thrilling milestone for me. It provided hands-on experience with the same skills engineers use to tackle real-world problems. I learned to create and implement algorithms, program robots using RobotC, and develop the strong work ethic required to handle complex tasks. My success in the program, marked by earning a NOCTI pre-engineering certification, confirmed my passion for computer science and motivated me to become a computer science major at Queens College.
										Currently, I am serving as a technical interview prep tech fellow at CodePath, where I aid students in their technical interview preparation. Additionally, I’m a research assistant collaborating with Professor Delaram Kahrobaei on cutting-edge research in AI and Post-Quantum Security. I am set to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics from Queens College, and I'm eager to apply my skills as a software engineer.
